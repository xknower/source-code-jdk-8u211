/**
 * JxBrowser inherits Google Chromium Plugin Architecture and supports plugins.
 * JxBrowser provides two rendering modes: heavyweight and lightweight. In heavyweight rendering mode all plugins
 * are displayed exactly as in Google Chrome. In lightweight rendering mode,
 * only plugins that support windowless rendering will be displayed properly.
 * <p>
 * Note: Since JxBrowser 6.4 only PPAPI plugins are supported because Chromium doesn't support NPAPI plugins in versions 49 and higher.
