/**
 * JxBrowser is based on the open source Chromium project, that includes source code
 * and libraries written by developers in the Chromium community. The project also includes a number of open source third-party libraries.
 * <p>
 * One of the key questions arising when open source code is used in commercial products,
 * is the permitted use of the open source code, and possible restrictions of use and distribution of the works based on this open source code.
 * <p>
 * We are performing a regular review of the licenses, associated with Chromium components used by JxBrowser,
 * to make sure that there are no terms that would restrict the commercial distribution of JxBrowser or the customer applications using it.
 * We also make sure that licenses requiring disclosure of the source code (like GPL) do not apply to JxBrowser or applications based on it.
 * <p>
 * Please see below the links to Chromium components' licenses associated with JxBrowser releases.
