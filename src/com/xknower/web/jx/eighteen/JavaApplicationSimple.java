 * JxBrowser can be deployed with your software distribution like any other standard Java library.
 * All you need to do is to include required JxBrowser JAR files and the license file into your application class path.
 * For example, you must include the following JAR files into your cross-platform Java application class path:
 * <p>
 * jxbrowser.jar
 * license.jar
 * jxbrowser-win32.jar
 * jxbrowser-win64.jar
 * jxbrowser-mac.jar
 * jxbrowser-linux64.jar
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note: If your application supports only Windows platform,
 * there is no need to include the jxbrowser-mac.jar, and jxbrowser-linux64.jar JAR files into your application class path.
